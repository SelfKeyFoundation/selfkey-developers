## SelfKey Connect Browser Extension
To create both a convenient user interface and a communications link between the IDW and the LWS server integration, we have developed SelfKey Connect - a Web Browser Extension that provides the user with a way to interact with the other related components directly from the browser window.  In its current implementation it can select available wallet addresses and unlock them remotely using password / keystore file and then choose the wallet for authentication using LWS simultaneously directing the IDW to pass over the data and documents requested by the server integration if needed.
