## Manage your Identity
Create your SelfKey ID with your personal details and KYC documents, such as a Passport, ID Card, Driver’s License, Proof of Address or a Selfie.

You only need to set up your SelfKey ID once, when it's done you won’t need to upload the documents again when applying for products and services.

All data and documents remain stored locally in your device – not in a SelfKey server or on the blockchain. No one has access to your information but you and it can never be shared without your consent.

## Manage your Crypto
With the SelfKey Wallet, you can create and manage multiple Ethereum addresses, add any new custom tokens you have and intuitively manage your portfolio with the latest market quotes. It connects seamlessly with Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet and JSON Keystore files.
You can send, recieve and store ETH, KEY and any ERC-20 token.
