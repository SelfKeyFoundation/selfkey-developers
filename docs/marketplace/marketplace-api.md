## SelfKey API Overview

The SelfKey API manages connections between the SelfKey Identity Wallet (IDW) and third party integrators that are part of the SelfKey Marketplace.  Currently the SelfKey Marketplace supports the listing of Digital Asset Exchanges and Incorporations Service Providers.  The SelfKey API is required to manage form submission requirements and data exchange formatting, making use of the SelfKey JSON Schema to manage data harmonization requested attributed and documents between the 3rd party integrator and the IDW. The API does not store any user data and is available to be audited by any Marketplace integrator.
