#### Integration & Acceptance Testing 
Our technical implementation team will work with you to integrate with your existing system using the SelfKey API gateway. For customers without an existing KYC solution who choose to use Quick-KYC by KYC-Chain we will implement their instance at this stage. Optionally, during this time our technical team can assist with Login with SelfKey implementation to make your SelfKey-referred customersâ€™ first experience on your platform quick and easy. 

#### Marketplace Listing 
Once all of the infrastructure is ready to start accepting new customers we will publish your listing on our marketplace and monitor performance over the coming weeks. 

#### Requirements Gathering
